What is Bunnymark?
================

This is the Bunnymark Mk I benchmark for Love2D.

The BunnyMark benchmark is an extremely simple benchmarking script used by a lot of JS graphics engines like PixiJS, EaselJS etc. In this benchmark sprites are spawned and moved around the screen. Roughly, the idea is to spawn the maximum possible number of sprites while keeping the fps at 60.

My version heavily references the script written by the PixiJS guys.

Controls
================
Left Clicking the mouse anywhere on the screen spawns a litter of bunnies (minimum 1000). The number of generated sprites can be increased or decreased by using the mousewheel.
